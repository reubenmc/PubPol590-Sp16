**THIS IS A LIVE DOCUMENT.** It will be updated until deemed satisfactory. Check back frequently or refresh to load any new changes and additions.

Below outlines some materials aimed in helping students gain the required R expertise to do basic Data Science. There are two major components:

1. [R basics with `swirl`](#swirl-courses)
2. [The `data.table` package](#exploratory-data-analysis-with-datatable)

## R Scripts

`init_swirl_courses.R` — running this script will install `swirl` and the recommended courses.

## `swirl` courses

Learning the basics of R will be self-paced using an interactive console program called [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/). Basic information on how to install and get swirl running can be found [**here**](http://swirlstats.com/students.html).

Information about courses can be found on the swirl dev teams [github repo](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses).

### Recommended `swirl` Course Completion Order

The following courses can be installed by running the `init_swirl_courses.R`. The order of completion that will best suite Data+ students is as follows (subject to change):

1. R Programming Alt
4. Open Intro
2. Data Analysis
6. Getting and Cleaning
7. Exploratory Data Analysis
8. Exploratory Data Analysis with `data.table` *(__NOT SWIRL__ - see next section)*
3. Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp *(time permitting)*
5. Regression Models *(time permitting)*

## Exploratory Data Analysis with `data.table`

An introduction to using `data.table` for Exploratory Data Analysis can be found over at [David Robinson's R Data lessons page](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/).

Complete [Lesson 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis with `data.table`](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/lessons/lesson4/).

Feel free to review by doing the other lessons.

### More on `data.table`

The `data.table` package is central to fast, efficient analysis of very large datasets aka Big Data. All the necessary documentation to learn more about `data.table` can be found [**here**](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Getting-started).

It is recommended that Data+ students working with Big Data work through all the introductory vignettes.

1. [Introduction to data.table](https://rawgit.com/wiki/Rdatatable/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro-vignette.html)
1. [Reference semantics](https://rawgit.com/wiki/Rdatatable/data.table/vignettes/datatable-reference-semantics.html)
1. [Keys and fast binary search based subsets](https://rawgit.com/wiki/Rdatatable/data.table/vignettes/datatable-keys-fast-subset.html)
2. (optional) [Efficient reshaping using data.tables](https://rawgit.com/wiki/Rdatatable/data.table/vignettes/datatable-reshape.html)

One can also work through the [Quick start guide](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/vignettes/datatable-intro.pdf).

## [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/): Courses on R & Data Science

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses) has numerous courses (some totally free, some free-to-start) on learning R and using R to do Data Science.

Recommended course — [Data Analysis the `data.table` Way](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-table-data-manipulation-r-tutorial). It is free to start. 

## General R Resources

Sample code and solutions for common tasks:

- [Cookbook-R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)

For a more advanced understanding of R:
